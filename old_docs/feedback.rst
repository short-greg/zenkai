Feedback alignment is a biologically plausible method to train neural networks. Zenkai makes several variations of feedback alignment available for use.


Classes and Functions
========


- :mod:`fa_target` - Create the target used for feedback 
- :mod:`OutT` - Used for specifying the target for direct feedback alignment. 
- :mod:`FALearner` - A learning machine for doing feedback alignment. 
- :mod:`DFALearner` - A learning machine for doing direct feedback alignment
